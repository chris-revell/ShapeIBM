# To do

- Remove elements in regions of high density as well as creating them in regions of low density
- Vary tension over boundary. How? Can't target elements or interactions due to boundary refinement. Can't think in terms of length along boundary if length changes. Proportion of boundary?
- Should tension in boundary be elastic or constant?
- Will probably need cytoskeleton interaction for more complex shapes.
- What measurement can we take? Quantitative results better than just "looks similar".


- Test leaks by calculating cell volume
  - How to calculate volume given non-trivial shape?
- Start cell as oblong shape
- Introduce matrix and tissue adhesion at tips

- Slide on biology motivation
- Where sensors are relative to cell/movement.
